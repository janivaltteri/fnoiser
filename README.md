# fnoiser

A 1/f noise generator package for R

Contains currently two functions:

1) fn1(t,g) generates a single vector of coloured noise with 
given length t and colour g,

2) fn1(t,g,r) generates a t*2 array of two coloured noises
with a correlation r.

This is currently being developed for fun. It may not work at all.
